 Ongoing second chance project - started Apr 25, 2022, must end by Apr 28, 2022 - you're done with 0% of tasks.
 An auto review will be launched at the deadline
In a nutshell…
Auto QA review: 0.0/90 mandatory & 0.0/35 optional
Altogether:  0.0%
Mandatory: 0.0%
Optional: 0.0%
Calculation:  0.0% + (0.0% * 0.0%)  == 0.0%

Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
How to use linked lists
Start to look for the right source of information without too much help
Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden
You are allowed to use _putchar
You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called lists.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded
More Info
Please use this data structure for this project:

/**
 * struct listint_s - singly linked list
 * @n: integer
 * @next: points to the next node
 *
 * Description: singly linked list node structure
 * 
 */
typedef struct listint_s
{
    int n;
    struct listint_s *next;
} listint_t;
Tasks
0. Print list
mandatory
Score: 0.00% (Checks completed: 0.00%)
Write a function that prints all the elements of a listint_t list.

Prototype: size_t print_listint(const listint_t *h);
Return: the number of nodes
Format: see example
You are allowed to use printf
